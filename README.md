## Hi, I’m Oshafi 👋

I’m a **Junior SOC / Security Operations Analyst (in training)** focused on learning how security alerts are investigated, documented, and responded to in real-world environments.

### What I’m currently working on
- Alert triage and incident analysis  
- Authentication, network, and endpoint security alerts  
- Writing clear investigation reports from SOC-style labs  

### Tools & environments
- LetsDefend (SOC Analyst Path)  
- Basic Linux and Windows logs  
- Networking fundamentals (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP)  
- Python (beginner, used for simple log analysis and automation)

### What you’ll find here
- Documented SOC investigations with reasoning and conclusions  
- Lab notes showing how I approach and learn from security alerts  
- Small scripts or tooling that support SOC workflows (when relevant)

### Current goal
Build strong fundamentals in security operations and become job-ready for a **Tier 1 SOC or SOC-adjacent role**.
