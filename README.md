## Hi, I’m Oshafi 👋

I’m a **Junior SOC / Security Operations Analyst (in training)** focused on learning how security alerts are investigated, documented, and responded to in real-world environments.

### What I’m currently working on
. Alert triage and incident analysis  
. Authentication, network, and endpoint security alerts  
. Writing clear investigation reports from SOC-style labs  

### Tools & environments
. LetsDefend (SOC Analyst Path)
. TryHackMe  
. Basic Linux and Windows logs  
. Networking fundamentals (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP)  

### What you’ll find here
. Documented SOC investigations with reasoning and conclusions  
. Lab notes showing how I approach and learn from security alerts  
. Small scripts or tooling that support SOC workflows
